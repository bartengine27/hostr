# Introduction

While developing it may be useful to have a setup which mirrors your final production setup as close as possible. In practice, hardware and/or time are not always available on time to setup a test or acception environment which mirrors production. Therefore, having a setup that you can easily (re-)deploy on a (local) virtual environment may be your way out.  

This project contains *Ansible* scripts to setup *Proxmox* and/or *Azure* VMs/containers to install a web site on prem or in the cloud to ease/speed-up development. The *Ansible* scripts in this project assume that you need servers to host the following roles:

* Web Server
* Cache
* Database
* Identity Server  
* REST API endpoints
* Prometheus monitoring
* Grafana dashboards

## Prerequisites

### Proxmox prerequisites

If you'd like to deploy on Proxmox, first install Proxmox on a host. Your host is a bare metal machine or a virtual machine with nesting enabled. [Qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) For instance, allows to nest VMs. **TBC**  

Depending on your particular installation and/or test requirements, it may be relevant to configure an *DNS* server during the *Proxmox* installation: this will ensure that the machine running *Proxmox* (bare metal or VM) and the VMs running on *Proxmox* all are in the same subnet.

In this document/config it is assumed that you will use the following domain(s):

```text
# the ip address of the machine that (will) run(s) your web site, for example the ip address of proxmox vm 100
192.168.1.60 cars.be
```

Add the entries above in the hosts file on

* the machine running the Ansible installation scripts
* the clients you use to visit the web site

If all has gone well, you should have (after running the *Ansible* scripts) a setup like:

![setup](./Proxmox%20setup.drawio.png)

#### Hyper-V install

You can install Proxmox on Windows Hyper-V. Create the virtual machine with the standard procedure and execute the following command in Powershell

```Powershell
Set-VMProcessor -VMName <Name of your Proxmox VM> -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true
``` 

to switch on Hyper-V's nested virtualization. Download and mount the Proxmox ISO, after booting, click in the VM screen and tap on Enter to start the install. If your install hangs at `Trying to detect country`, disable your internet connection and restart the installer.  

After installing Proxmox on Hyper-V, you will notice that calling an endpoint on your Hyper-V VM from WSL2 doesn't work. Open the Hyper-V Manager and next the Virtual Switch Manager

![Switches](./wsl_hypervvm_switches.png)

and not the two different virtual switches. As documented [on](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/windows-subsystem-for-linux-2-addressing-traffic-routing-issues/ba-p/1764074) we need to enable forwarding across both virtual switches:

```Powershell
Get-NetIPInterface | where {$_.InterfaceAlias -eq 'vEthernet (Default Switch)' -or $_.InterfaceAlias -eq 'vEthernet (WSL (Hyper-V firewall))'} | Set-NetIPInterface -Forwarding Enabled
```

:fire: Note the **vEthernet(...)** in the IP interface aliases, if you are not sure about the aliases, first run

```Powershell
Get-NetIPInterface
```

and check the second column.  

#### Bare metal install

Follow the default installation procedure [on](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/get-started).

#### Promox API user

Before using the Ansible scripts, you will need a Proxmox API user:
* Log into the Proxmox Web UI
* Select datacenter from the left menu
* Select users from the left sub-menu
* We will use the default root@pam user
* Select API tokens from the left sub-menu
* Click add
    * User: root@pam
    * Token ID: input a random string, for [example](https://www.random.org/passwords/?num=1&len=24&format=plain&rnd=new) and record the token ID
    * record the token secret

After adding the user and API token, select Datacenter and click on Permissions and Add API Token Permission. Choose
* Path: /
* API Token: root@pam<tokenID>
* Role: Administrator
* Propagate: select

### Azure prerequisites

TODO

### Ansible prerequisites

As we are using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to automate our install and deploy, you will have to meet the following minimum requirements on the hosts which will run the *Ansible* scripts: [Ansible minimum requirements](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/proxmox_module.html).

For this project, we will need some extra dependencies. Install the following *Ansible* role(s):

```bash
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.redis
```

:fire: Microsoft has an ansible SQL Server role which supports RHEL, as we use Ubuntu for now, the Microsoft Ansible SQL Server role is not usable.

or write all dependencies to a `requirements.yml` file

```yaml
---
roles:
  - name: geerlingguy.redis
    type: galaxy
    source: https://galaxy.ansible.com

collections:
  # With just the collection name
  - my_namespace.my_collection    
```

and install with:

```bash
ansible-galaxy role install -r requirements.yml #what we use
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
```

Add additional Python dependencies with:

```bash
pip install proxmoxer
```

### Secrets prerequisites

Secrets are stored in env variables in files

* .env
* .env.prod
* .env.acc
* .env.dev

Keep your *PROD*, *ACC* and *DEV* secrets in the corresponding files and copy to `.env` before you start the ansible scripts. `source` .env Before executing your first Ansible script.

:fire: Obviously, none of the `env` files belongs in your repo.

Your `env` file should at least contain your public key to connect with ssh to the VMs:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export SSH_PUB_KEY="ssh-rsa AAAAB.... your_name@your_machine"
```

If you are unsure about your public key, check `~/.ssh/id_rsa_pub`.

## Proxmox

### Proxmox VM setup

As far as I know, *Ansible* is not the tool of choice to setup *VM*s on cloud/datacenter solutions like *Azure*, *Proxmox*, etc. Nevertheless, as an excercise, I've chosen to setup my *Azure* and *Proxmox* *VM*s with *Ansible*.  

*Ansible* Uses an `inventory` to define the machines (*ip addresses*) and machine roles to install/setup your software infrastructure. As we start with a clean install (no existing *VM*s), it is rather difficult to define an `inventory`.  

Therefore, we start with a play `proxmox.cars.be` which has a [vars file](./playbooks/proxmox.cars.be/vars/main.yml) defining the *inventory*, for example:

```yml
proxmox_vms:
 - ip: 192.168.1.60
   id: 600
   group:
    - "webserver"
 - ip: 192.168.1.61
   id: 601
   group:
    - "redis"
 - ip: 192.168.1.62
   id: 602
   group:
    - "database"
```

On the other hand, it is probably wise to structure/group *ip addresses* and *vm id*s under `group:` which is more aligned with an *Ansible inventory* (and easier to maintain). :fire: That's for another version.  

After running the [proxmox.cars.be](./playbooks/proxmox.cars.be/) play, we can use the initialized *VM*s as defined in the [vars file](./playbooks/proxmox.cars.be/vars/main.yml) as the basis for the *Ansible* `Ã¬nventory`.  

Running the [proxmox.cars.be](./playbooks/proxmox.cars.be/) play is detailed in [Uploading templates](###uploading-proxmox-vm(s)-templates) and [Installing VMs on Proxmox](###installing-proxmox-vm(s)).  

The [hosts](./playbooks/hosts) file contains the `inventory` for the other *Ansible* plays. :fire: At this moment, the [hosts](./playbooks/hosts) file is not generated from the [proxmox.cars.be](./playbooks/proxmox.cars.be/) play, it is probably a good idea to change that in future versions.  

### Proxmox hosts file

You can pass a hosts file to the `ansible-playbook` command with:

```bash
-i ./hosts
```

### Uploading Proxmox VM(s) templates

```bash
ansible-playbook proxmox_ubuntu_vm-setup.yml -K --tags=vm_upload -vvv
```

:fire: If this tag fails, you may have to upgrade your community.general modules, see [issue](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/6974):

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
```

you should have at least version 7.2.1

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection list
```

and look for community.general.

:fire: You probably have two installs of community.general, if you'd like to run the system-wide install:

```bash
sudo ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
```

### Installing Proxmox VM(s)

```bash
ansible-playbook proxmox_ubuntu_vm-setup.yml -K --tags=vm_init -vvv
```

### Stopping Proxmox VM(s)

```bash
ansible-playbook proxmox_ubuntu_vm-setup.yml -K --tags=vm_stop -vvv
```

### Starting Proxmox VM(s)

```bash
ansible-playbook proxmox_ubuntu_vm-setup.yml -K --tags=vm_start -vvv
```

if necessary, you can restart with

```bash
ansible-playbook proxmox_ubuntu_vm-setup.yml -K --tags=vm_restart -vvv
```

delete the VMs with

```bash
ansible-playbook proxmox_ubuntu_vm-setup.yml -K --tags=vm_stop -vvv
ansible-playbook proxmox_ubuntu_vm-setup.yml -K --tags=vm_remove -vvv
```

### Removing Proxmox VM(s)

Before removing a Proxmox VM, first stop the Proxmox VM, so execute the [stopping proxmox](#stopping-proxmox-vms) command or add tag vm_stop before the *vm_remove* tag in the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook proxmox_ubuntu_vm-setup.yml -K --tags=vm_remove -vvv
```

### SSH into the Proxmox VM

```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.60 -i /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

## Azure

TODO

## Redis

### Install Redis

```bash
ansible-playbook redis-setup.yml -i hosts -K -vvv
```

:fire: Note the `hosts` file, at the moment, only ip address are used in the host file. In an ideal case, hostnames as setup on *Proxmox* should be used grouped by labels redis, webserver, etc.

:fire: If you get an error like

```bash
 "msg": "Unable to start service redis-server: Job for redis-server.service failed because the control process exited with error code.\nSee \"systemctl status redis-server.service\" and \"journalctl -xe\" for details.\n"
```

after running the redis playbook, you probably forgot to `source .env`.  

## Identity Server

### Install Identity Server

`ABP` supports [IdentityServer4](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4) and [OpenIddict](https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-core). As the `ABP` startup templates support *OpenIddict* since *ABP v6.0.0* we will only support `OpenIddict`.  

```bash
ansible-playbook identityserver-setup.yml -i hosts -K -vvv
```

## REST API

### Install REST API

```bash
ansible-playbook httpapiserver-setup.yml -i hosts -K -vvv
```

The *REST API* contains a custom metric and controller, open the *REST API* interface (`Swagger`) and call `/api/car/increment` to increment the custom metric. If you'd like to monitor this metric in real-time, *SSH* into the [HTTP server](./playbooks/hosts) and run:  

```bash
#if nessary, install dotnet-counters
#dotnet tool install --global dotnet-counters
dotnet-counters monitor --name Be.Cars.HttpApi.Host --counters Be.Cars.Metrics.CustomMetrics
```

## Database

### Install SQL Server

```bash
ansible-playbook database-setup.yml -i hosts -K -vvv
```

## Web server

### Install the Blazor Application

For this project, we will host the application (Blazor application) on [Kestrel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel?view=aspnetcore-7.0). `Kestrel` is automatically included by publishing the application.

```bash
ansible-playbook webserver-setup.yml -i hosts -K -vvv
```

:fire: Install the web server after installing the database: while installing the web server, the DB migration project will run and initialize the database.  

## Application Performance Monitoring

In this project we will use [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) as it supports [OTLP (Open Telemetry Protocol)](https://opentelemetry.io/) which is used in the example code (web site and REST API). You can also export OTel (Open Telemetry) data to [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) or [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/). For an overview, please check the following list of  [APM (Application Performance Monitoring) vendors](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/vendors/).

```mermaid
flowchart TD;    
    WebServer[Web Server]-- ":5000/metrics" -->Prometheus;
    RESTAPI[REST API]-- ":5000/metrics" -->Prometheus;
    Prometheus-- ":9090" -->Grafana
```

:fire: The example code is written in dotnet core, which has its own instrumentation APIs for logging, metrics and tracing. Therefore, OTel collects telemetry from the build in dotnet core APIs. The benefit that OTel brings as an industry standard is a common mechanism for collecting telemetry data and integrating APMs. For more information [see](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/observability-with-otel).

:fire: If you are using a different programming language, please check the [supported programming languages](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/).  

### Prometheus server

As illustrated in the figure above, Prometheus is configured with the metrics endpoints of the Web Server and REST API. Extend this configuration if you'd like to inlude other systems/microservices/etc.

#### Install Prometheus server

```bash
ansible-playbook prometheusserver-setup.yml -i hosts -K -vvv
```

### Grafana server

#### Install Grafana server

```bash
ansible-playbook grafanaserver-setup.yml -i hosts -K -vvv
```

After installing *Grafana*, you can browse to the *Grafana* endpoint (check the *Grafana* endpoint in [hosts](./playbooks/hosts)) and open the `ASP .NET Core` dashboard:
